# PIC_Polynomials
Project designed with Ricardo Mesquita (ECU) to calculate the nth degree polinomials that fit motor unit firing rates from HD-EMG measurements

This code was written for the sole purpose of creating smooth visualisation of motor unit firing rates and allow the user to manually sellect outliers that might 
have been missed during the initial analysis. 

The code sould be used following data processing using the DEMUSE tool (https://demuse.feri.um.si/#:~:text=DEMUSE%20Tool&text=Muscles%20consist%20of%20motor%20units,rate%20(see%20MU%20identification).
